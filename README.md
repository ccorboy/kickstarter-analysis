# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
The following analysis will assist Louise in moving forward with her Kickstarter Campaign to fund a play in the United States.

### Purpose
Louise is curious about the launch dates and the funding goals of other plays. Through this analysis, Louise will acquire the information needed to move forward with her play. She will know what part of the year plays have higher success of launching, as well as how much money she should ask for in order to fund her project. The objective of this analysis is the visualize the data, making it easier and quicker to read. 


## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis is executed through Microsoft Excel. With the use of pivot tables and pivot charts, specific data is separated from the origianl worksheet and visualized to summarize the findings. Through this process the only difficulties are navigating through Excel without much prior experience. The most difficult part is the correct use of formulas/functions. It becomes especially tricky when the contents of a formula become larger and hold different columns. For example, when using the COUNTIFS() function, data from three different columns in the orignial worksheet are needed to figure out how many plays required specific quantities of money. This process not only becomes easier after repitition and familiarity with the function, but also after watching a tutorial video or two to help grasp a better understadning.
